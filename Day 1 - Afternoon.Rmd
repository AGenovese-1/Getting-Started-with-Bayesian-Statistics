# Estimating the Probability of "Success" and "Failure"

## Inference for Bernoulli/Binomial Probability (Proportion)

### Elements of Bayesian Analysis

Unlike hodge-podge of ad hoc procedures proliferating frequentist methods, there is a unified, straightforward logic:  

> *Everything to be learned from data is captured in the likelihood; the only proper way to process this information is through __Baye's Rule__*

* What are you estimating?  
  + Parameter(s) or some quantity that can be calculated from parameters

* How should you encode your starting uncertainty (prior)?

* How should you model the data-generating process (likelihood)?

* How can you calculate (or avoid calculating) the marginal likelihood?

### The Simple Case of a (Possibly) Unfair Coin: Binomial Distribution

* __Question__ : If we flip a possibly unfair coin n times, how can we use the outcomes as evidence to estimate the probability of *heads*?

* __Motivation__ : Substitute independent repeated observations of any data-generating process where each instance has only two possible outcomes:
  + "Success" and "Failure"

* Imagine I have one of these coins in my hand, flip it and get H. How can you incorporate that information (data) in estimating $\theta$?  

$p(\theta|data) = \frac{p(\theta)p(data|\theta)}{p(data)}$

* For each of the possible parameter values, we know the probability that we would have observed *heads*.
  + That is, we know the probability distribution associated with any $\theta$
  + What is a probability distribution? Tentative/simplistic version: (a) All possible outcomes of the data-generating process (measurements, observations) and (b) the probability associated with each.
   
### One Coin Flip: Heads

* Prior probabilities
  + 0 to 1 in increments of 0.1
  + Favoring fair coin slightly
  + Far less belief in extremely unfair coin than nearly fair
  
* Compare *maximum likelihood* estimate to modal posterior estimate
  + MLE asks what $\theta$ makes the observed data most likely
  + MAP (max a posteriori) asks which $\theta$ is most plausible in light of the data (and prior) 
  
### Binomial Distribution (Number of "successes" on multiple observations)

* Binomial Distribution - probability formula representation
  + Suppose *N* independent observations (cases, trials) of a process
  + Assume all observations based on same probability $\theta$
  + How to calculate the probability of Y = y successes (e.g. heads of coins)?

* N = 2
  + $\ P(Y=0) = \theta^{0}(1-\theta)^{2}$
  + $\ P(Y=1) = 2\theta^{1}(1-\theta)^{1}$
  + $\ P(Y=2) = \theta^{2}(1-\theta)^{0}$
  
* Example
  + $\theta = 0.10$
  + $\ = 0.10^{0}(0.90^{2}) = 0.81$
  + $\ = 2(0.10^{1})(0.90^{1}) = 0.18$
  + $\ = 0.10^{2}(0.90^{0}) = 0.01$

For **fixed** (or known) parameter and varying possible observations (data), we wind up with a probability distribution.
**Note**: Sums to 1

For fixed (or observed) observations (data), varying possible parameter values, we wind up with a likelihood function
**Note**: Does not sum to 1

* Binomial Probability Distribution (probability mass function)
  + $\ p(Y = y|\theta, N) = \frac{N!}{(y!)(N-y)!}\theta^{y}(1-\theta)^{N-y}$ Fixed parameter, varying observations
  
* Binomial Likelihood
  + $\ L(\theta|y, N) = \frac{N!}{(y!)(N-y)!}\theta^{y}(1-\theta)^{N-y}$ Fixed data, varying parameter
  
> **EXAMPLE**
```{r echo=TRUE}
set.seed(22) ## set seed for replication
heads <- rbinom(1, 100, 0.5) ## simulate flipping a fair coin 100 times
heads # 52

biased_prob <- 0.6 ## What is the likelihood that the probability is 0.6?
choose(100, heads)*(biased_prob**heads)*(1-biased_prob)**48 ## Manual calculation
# 0.02148776
dbinom(heads, 100, biased_prob) ## R Calculation
# 0.02148776

likelihood <- function(p){
  dbinom(heads, 100, p)
} ## Function to test likelihood of values of p

likelihood(biased_prob)
# 0.02148776

negative_likelihood <- function(p){
  dbinom(heads, 100, p)*-1
} ## Negative likelihood to maximize the minimizing function, nlm.
negative_likelihood(biased_prob)
# -0.02148776 

nlm(negative_likelihood, 0.5, stepmax=0.5)
# $minimum: -0.07965256 
## Denotes minimum value of negative likelihood - so the maximum likelihood is this value multiplied by -1
# $estimate: 0.5199995 
## MLE Estimate of p
# $gradient: -2.775558e-11
## Gradient of the likelihood function in the vicinity of our estimate of p - we would expect this to be very close to zero for a successful estimate
```

# Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

## Simulating Draws from a Posterior Distribution

### Bayesian Methods and MCMC

* Metropolis-Hastings
* Gibbs Sampler (e.g. in BUGS, JAGS)
* What is Markov Chain Monte Carlo?
* Limitations of approaches so far
  + Grid approximation (Provide prior probability for many specific values of $\theta$)
  + Conjugate Distributions (e.g. Beta and Bernoulli)
* Suppose you can evaluate prior and likelihood up to a constant

  + $\ p(\theta|data)∝p(\theta)p(data|\theta)$

* The Island-Hopping Politician Metaphor
  + How to visit islands in archipelago so time spent per island is proportional to island pop.?
  + When on an island, you only know population of that island and those adjacent.

* Follow this set of rules (algorithm)
  + Flip a coin to decide which of adjacent islands to propose visiting next
  + If proposed island has higher pop., go there
  + If proposed island has lower pop., go there with probability = lowpop/highpop
  + $\ p_{move} = min (\frac{P(\theta_{proposed})}{P(\theta_{current})})$
